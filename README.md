# restart_universal_strategies
This repository contains the code used for the simulations in 'Restart Strategies in a Continuous Setting'.

The folders genpareto, levy and lognormal contains the raw data of the simulations used in the paper.

The files main.py, restart_distribution.pyx, and write_restarts.py are the scripts used to simulate Luby's strategy. Additionally, are also used to find the optimal restart times and simulate the fixed-cutoff strategy.

The file Evaluate_restart_data.ipynb is a jupyter notebook file which is used to analyze the raw data in the three folders.
